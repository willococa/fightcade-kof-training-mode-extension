  <h3><b>FightCade Training Mode extension for KOF</b></h3>
<p> This is an extension for the fighcade Training Mode On the KoF Games, it is tested and
developed mainly for kof 98, but it should work in other KOF's until 2k2 (had a little test on this but don't take my word for it)
most KOF  have the same memory addresses  and functions on the original script <a href="https://github.com/peon2/fbneo-training-mode">fbneo-training-mode</a></p>
